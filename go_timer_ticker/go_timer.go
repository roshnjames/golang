/*Timers represent a single event in the future.
You tell the timer how long you want to wait,
and it provides a channel(C) that will be notified at that time.
This timer will wait 5 seconds.
The <-timer1.C blocks on the timerâ€™s channel C until it
sends a value indicating that the timer fired.*/
