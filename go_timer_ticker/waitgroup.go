/*
Alternative to Sleep()------
Waitgroup is a feature of sync package which allows to wait before termination of the program
until the internal counter of waitgroup becomes 0.

SYNTAX----variable_name:=new(sync.WaitGroup)

Internal counter value can be manipulated using the following functions----->>>
Add(int)	---- It increases WaitGroup counter by given integer value.
Done()  ---  It decreases WaitGroup counter by 1, we will use it to indicate termination of a goroutine.
Wait() --- It Blocks the execution until itâ€™s internal counter becomes 0.
